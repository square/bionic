=============
Release Notes
=============

This page attempts to document all non-trivial user-visible changes in each Bionic
release. ("Non-trivial" means, for example, we won't include fixes to typos in
documentation.)

Versioning Scheme
-----------------

The Bionic project follows a modified version of `Semantic Versioning
<https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_ ("SemVer"), using a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version
number. We try to avoid backwards-incompatible changes (even though SemVer doesn't
require this until version 1.0). However, since Bionic is still in a fairly early
stage, we'd like to retain the option of making breaking changes to rarely-used
features of Bionic. Thus, our policy is not to make any backwards-incompatible change
before version 1 **unless** we've discussed it with known Bionic users beforehand.
Currently all known Bionic users work at Square -- if you're not at Square but would
like to be included in this group, let us know on our `issue tracker
<https://github.com/square/bionic/issues>`_.

We also tend to release new functionality with PATCH releases. (In SemVer this would
happen in MINOR releases). We tend to issue a MINOR release when we've accumulated a
significant amount of new functionality; when we make a breaking change (as described
above); or when we make a Cache Compatibility Change (as described below).

Once we reach 1.0, we plan to follow SemVer exactly.

Types of Changes
----------------

For each release, we list the following types of change (in this order):

- **New Bugs**: Notable bugs (i.e., failure to behave the way the documentation
  says it should) introduced by this release.
- **Breaking Changes**: Any other non-backwards-compatible changes in behavior.
  Includes any difference in any returned value, thrown exception class, or
  value passed to a user-provided function. Does **not** include performance
  changes; bug fixes; changes in log output, error messages, or warnings;
  changes in visualizations; changes in documentation or docstrings; changes to
  features marked as experimental; changes when using Bionic in a way that the
  documentation tells you not to; or gracefully-handled changes to the cache data
  format (see next entry). We try to avoid breaking changes outside of major version
  releases.
- **Cache Compatibility Changes**: Any case where this release of Bionic cannot read
  cached data generated by a previous release **but** handles the situation
  gracefully by automatically recomputing (and re-caching) values instead of
  loading old ones. If Bionic doesn't handle this gracefully, this is marked as
  a bug instead.
- **Deprecated Features**: Features which are still supported but may be
  removed in a future version. (This removal will count as a breaking change.)
  If a feature is deprecated, it will be noted in the appropriate docstring
  and Bionic will emit a warning message when the feature is used.
- **New Features**: New capabilities which need to be explicitly activated by
  the user, generally through new functions or new arguments to existing
  functions.
- **Improvements**: Any improvements (other than bug fixes) that don't require code
  changes from the user to activate, such as improved performance or clearer logging.
- **Bug Fixes**: Any changes in Bionic's behavior that bring it closer to what the
  existing documentation would lead one to expect.
- **Documentation Changes**: Significant changes to Bionic's documentation;
  does not include changes associated with anything appearing in these notes
  (those are already assumed to be documented) or small corrections.
- **Development Changes**: Significant changes to Bionic's development process, such
  as changes to our Pytest configuration or our Continuous Integration ("CI").

Upcoming Version (Not Yet Released)
-----------------------------------

.. Record any notable changes in this section. When we update the current version,
   add a new version heading below, and then comment out the heading above until more
   changes are added. This way, the "Upcoming Version" section will be never be visible
   in the "stable" docs (corresponding to the last release) but will be visible in the
   "latest" docs (corresponding to the master branch).

New Features
............

- ``Flow`` now has a :meth:`Flow.reload <bionic.Flow.reload>` method that
  updates the flow instance to use reloaded modules. It is similar to
  `Flow.reloading <bionic.Flow.reloading>`, but modifies the flow instance in
  place.

Cache Compatibility Changes
...........................

- This release of Bionic cannot load cached data created by previous releases.
  Instead of attempting to load old an old cached value, Bionic will recompute
  (and re-cache) a new value.

Deprecated Features
...................

- Bionic no longer supports Matplotlib version 3.2.x, since that version can cause
  crashes on Mac OS when using multiprocessing. Versions 3.1.x and 3.3+ are still
  supported.

Bug Fixes
.........

- Fixed an `issue <https://github.com/square/bionic/issues/111>`_ where non-persistable
  entities could be spuriously recomputed even when their values weren't directly
  needed.
- Fixed an `issue <https://github.com/square/bionic/issues/229>`_ where caching fails
  when cache directory paths contain whitespaces.

Documentation
.............

- Fixed broken link in the documentation for the
  :class:`FileCopier <bionic.filecopier.FileCopier>` class.

0.8.3 (Jul 23, 2020)
--------------------

Deprecated Features
...................

- The utility function ``bionic.util.init_basic_logging`` has been moved to
  ``bionic.utils.misc.init_basic_logging``. However, the original name is still
  supported for now. (The only reason we mention this here and provide a deprecation
  path is because this function is currently mentioned in our documentation. Other
  internal functions are regularly moved and renamed without comment.)

New Features
............

- Persistence can be globally disabled with the ``core__persist_by_default`` entity,
  which means you can opt-in which entities are persisted instead of opting out.
- `JSON <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`_-serializable values are now serialized and
  cached using the JSON format (instead of the Pickle format). Bionic will do this
  automatically when an entity function returns a JSON-able value, but it can also be
  explicitly controlled with the new :func:`@json <bionic.protocol.json>` protocol.

Improvements
............

- Bionic's cache now makes fewer round-trip calls to the storage system (local disk
  or GCS) while reading and writing data. This might (or might not) improve performance
  if your connection to GCS is slow.

Bug Fixes
.........

- The previous release introduced a bug where Bionic would fail to recognize
  directory artifacts when they were stored in GCS, and would just recompute the values
  instead. (Most artifacts are stored as a single file, so this mainly affected the
  :func:`@dask <bionic.protocol.dask>` and :func:`@path <bionic.protocol.path>`
  protocols.)

Development Changes
...................

- When parallel tests are not enabled, the extra tests are ignored, not skipped.

0.8.2 (Jul 10, 2020)
--------------------

Improvements
............

- Bionic now gracefully handles the situations where a cached artifact file is deleted
  but the corresponding metadata entry is not. (It now deletes the invalid metadata file
  and computes a new artifact and metadata entry.)

Bug Fixes
.........

- Fixed a bug in :meth:`FlowBuilder.add_case <bionic.FlowBuilder.add_case>`: if the
  ordering of the entity names changed from case to case, some values would sometimes
  get assigned to the wrong entity.
- Parallel execution (introduced in 0.8.0) had a bug in logging where log messages were
  dropped (with a warning) when any argument to the log message was unpickleable.
- The cache API (introduced in 0.8.0) had a bug where if two cache entries point to the
  same artifact, deleting one of them could leave the other in a bad state.

0.8.1 (Jul 6, 2020)
--------------------

Documentation Changes
.....................

- Fixed some typos in the documentation.

0.8.0 (Jul 6, 2020)
--------------------

Cache Compatibility Changes
...........................

- This release of Bionic cannot load cached data created by previous releases.
  Instead of attempting to load old an old cached value, Bionic will recompute
  (and re-cache) a new value.

New Features
............

- Bionic flows can now be run :ref:`in parallel <parallel-execution>`, taking advantage
  of multiple CPUs at once.
- Memoization can be globally disabled with the ``core__memoize_by_default`` entity,
  which means you can opt-in which entities are memoized instead of opting out.
- Bionic now allows entities to have no caching at all. Previously each entity needed
  to be cached either in memory or on disk; now both of these can be disabled, in which
  case it will be recomputed each time it's needed.
- `GeoPandas <https://geopandas.org>`_ DataFrames can now be serialized and cached.
  Bionic will do this automatically when an entity function returns a value of the
  appropriate type, but it can also be explicitly controlled with the new
  :func:`@geodataframe <bionic.protocol.geodataframe>` protocol.
- Bionic now provides an :ref:`API <cache-api>` for listing and deleting cached
  artifacts.

Documentation Changes
.....................

- This Release Notes page was added!

Development Changes
...................

- Updated release process to use GitHub releases.
- Moved CI and releases from Travis to GitHub Actions.
- CI tests are now run using Python 3.8 (in addition to 3.7 and 3.6).
- Add `flake8-print <https://pypi.org/project/flake8-print/>`_, `flake8-fixme
  <https://pypi.org/project/flake8-fixme/>`_ to CI, and configure flake8 to warn on
  unused imports.

0.7.1 (May 11, 2020)
--------------------

New Features
............
- The :func:`@picklable <bionic.protocol.picklable>` decorator now accepts a
  ``pickle_protocol_version`` argument, which can be used to control the data
  format used by Python's `Pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_
  module.

Improvements
............

- "Unset" entity (entities that are declared but have no value set) are now
  handled more cleanly. They now appear in the DAG visualization; if an entity value
  can't be computed because one of its ancestors is unset, the exception message now
  describes the exact problem and the name of the problematic ancestor; and the
  ``@gather`` decorator now handles "missing" values more consistently by treating them
  as an empty set of values.
- Bionic now uses `version 4
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format>`_ of the Pickle
  data format by default, so objects larger than 4 GB can be serialized without
  crashing.

Bug Fixes
.........

- The `Protocol Interface`_ now matches what is documented (it had drifted out of
  sync).

.. _Protocol Interface: api/protocols.rst#custom-protocols

0.7.0 (Apr 7, 2020)
-------------------

Cache Compatibility Changes
...........................

- This release of Bionic cannot load cached data created by previous releases.
  Instead of attempting to load old an old cached value, Bionic will recompute
  (and re-cache) a new value.

New Features
............

- :meth:`Flow.render_dag <bionic.Flow.render_dag>` can now output the DAG as SVG in
  addition to existing formats.  When SVG is used, entity docstrings appear as
  tooltips. SVG is the new default format for rendering in Jupyter Notebooks.
- The :func:`@changes_per_run <bionic.changes_per_run>` decorator was added; this
  tells Bionic that a function is non-deterministic and should be re-run for each
  instance of a Flow.

Improvements
............

- Exceptions originating in user-defined entity functions are now reported more
  clearly and include the name of the entity.
- Cache invalidation now takes into account the hashed of immediate
  dependencies (not just top-level ancestors), reducing the number of
  unnecessary invalidations and recomputations.
- The exception message for using protocol decorators with positional arguments
  (such as ``@bn.protocol.frame('parquet')``), which is not allowed, is now
  clearer.

Bug Fixes
.........

- The failure to load cached data from older versions of Bionic, introduced in
  version 0.6.4, was fixed.

Documentation Changes
.....................

- Some missing decorators were added to the `API documentation <api/decorators.rst>`_.
- The installation instructions were updated to work correctly on `Zsh
  <https://www.zsh.org/>`_.

Development Changes
...................

- Adopted the `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ code
  formatter and configured CI to run it automatically.

0.6.4 (Mar 3, 2020)
-------------------

New Bugs
........

- This release crashed when attempting to load cached data from older versions
  of Bionic. This was fixed in version 0.7.0.

Cache Compatibility Changes
...........................

- This release of Bionic cannot load cached data created by previous releases.
  Instead of attempting to load old an old cached value, Bionic will recompute
  (and re-cache) a new value.

New Features
............

- The :func:`@docs <bionic.docs>` decorator was added, allowing separate docstrings to be
  associated with multiple entities generated by the same function.
- The :func:`@path <bionic.protocol.path>` protocol was added, allowing `Path
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>`_ values to work cleanly with
  Bionic's cache.

Improvements
............

- The Bionic cache directory can now be renamed or moved without breaking it.

Deprecated Features
...................

- Attaching a docstring to a function that generates multiple entities (using
  :func:`@outputs <bionic.outputs>`) is deprecated; instead, use the new :func:`@docs <bionic.docs>`
  decorator to specify a seperate docstring for each entity.

Development Changes
...................

- Travis config was updated to always use the most recent versions of all
  dependencies.
- Regression tests were added to check that Bionic is capable of loading cached
  data from the previous versions. (This was intended to catch regressions like
  the one introduced in version 0.5.7, but unfortunately was too late to catch the one
  introduced in this version.)

0.6.3 (Dec 24, 2019)
--------------------

Bug Fixes
.........

- Bionic no longer attempts to initialize `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ in
  a special way on OS X, which was needed for versions of Matplotlib earlier than
  3.1, but caused crashes for 3.1 and later.

0.6.2 (Dec 13, 2019)
--------------------

Improvements
............

- Entity-specific documentation is now visible in the docstrings for the
  shorthand ``get`` and ``set`` methods, as in
  ``help(flow.get.my_entity_name)``.

0.6.1 (Nov 13, 2019)
--------------------

Bug Fixes
.........

- The failure to load cached data from older versions of Bionic, introduced in
  version 0.5.7, was fixed.

0.6.0 (Nov 7, 2019)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
................

- Bionic no longer supports any Python version below 3.6. In particular, we no
  longer support Python 2.

0.5.7 (Nov 6, 2019)
-------------------

New Bugs
........

- This release crashed when attempting to load cached data from older versions
  of Bionic. This was fixed in version 0.6.1.

New Features
............

- :meth:`Flow.get <bionic.Flow.get>` now has a ``mode`` argument, which can be used to
  retrieve the cached files for entities rather than their in-memory
  representations.
- :meth:`Flow.merge <bionic.Flow.merge>` can now be called with ``keep`` values of
  ``"self"`` or ``"arg"``; these do the same things as ``"old"`` and ``"new"``,
  respectively, but were deemed clearer. The older values are still supported but may
  be deprecated in the future.

Improvements
............

- Bionic is now released as a universal wheel, not just a source distribution.

Deprecated Features
...................

- :meth:`Flow.get <bionic.Flow.get>`'s ``fmt`` argument is deprecated; instead, use
  ``collection``, which does the same thing.  (The name ``fmt`` is confusing,
  since it would seem to do what the new ``mode`` argument does rather than
  what ``collection`` does.)
- :meth:`Flow.export <bionic.Flow.export>` is now deprecated; use the new ``mode``
  argument of :meth:`Flow.get <bionic.Flow.get>` instead.

0.5.6 (Oct 23, 2019)
--------------------

This release had no user-facing changes.

Development Changes
...................

- Bionic releases are now generated automatically by CI.

0.5.5 (Oct 23, 2019)
--------------------

This release had no user-facing changes. It was an attempt to start
automatically releasing via CI, but that didn't work.

0.5.4 (Oct 22, 2019)
--------------------

New Features
............

- The :func:`@yaml <bionic.protocol.yaml>` protocol was added, allowing entities to be
  serialized as YAML files.

Improvements
............

- Bionic no longer uses certain recent features of `PyYAML <https://pyyaml.org/>`_,
  allowing it to be used with PyYAML 3.13. This in turn means it can be used with
  versions of `Apache Beam <https://beam.apache.org/>`_ (such as 2.15.0) which require
  PyYAML to have a version less than 4.0.

0.5.3 (Oct 21, 2019)
--------------------

Bug Fixes
.........

- Fixed a bug where Bionic would sometimes import parts of the `PIL
  <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ module in an order which could cause a
  crash.

0.5.2 (Oct 17, 2019)
--------------------

Bug Fixes
.........

- Fixed the bug introduced in 0.5.0, where ``None`` values could not be cached.

0.5.1 (Oct 11, 2019)
--------------------

New Features
............

- The :func:`@pyplot <bionic.pyplot>` decorator now accepts a ``savefigs_kwargs``
  argument, which can be used to customize Matplotlib's behavior when saving a plot.

Improvements
............

- Matplotlib plots are now saved using ``bbox_inches="tight"`` by default.

Documentation Changes
.....................

- The introductory documentation and tutorials were substantially reworded.

0.5.0 (Oct 9, 2019)
-------------------

New Bugs
........

- This release introduced a bug where Bionic would crash when attempting to
  cache a ``None`` value to disk. The bug was fixed in 0.5.2.

Cache Compatibility Changes
...........................

- This release of Bionic cannot load cached data created by previous releases.
  Instead of attempting to load old an old cached value, Bionic will recompute
  (and re-cache) a new value.

New Features
............

- Bionic now supports :ref:`automatic-versioning` to help reduce the chance
  of forgetting to update the ``@version`` decorator.

Improvements
............

- The "Computed ..." log message is now logged immediately after an entity
  value is computed, so that the total compute time can be more accurately
  estimated from log timestamps.
- Reading cache files is faster now that Bionic uses the C-based PyYAML loader.

Development Changes
...................

- Some Pytest tests are now designated "slow", and will only be run when the
  ``--slow`` option is passed to ``pytest``.

0.4.5 (Oct 8, 2019)
-------------------

Improvements
............

- Chained exceptions are now used (only in Python 3) to report caching errors
  more clearly.
- A clearer error message is reported when attempting to serialize a Pandas
  DataFrame with duplicate column names with Parquet (which doesn't work).
- Writing cache files is faster now that Bionic uses the C-based PyYAML dumper.

Bug Fixes
.........

- Fixed a bug causing entities using :func:`@gather <bionic.gather>` to be spuriously
  recomputed (rather than loaded from the cache) in some situations.

0.4.4 (Oct 4, 2019)
-------------------

New Features
............

- `Dask <https://dask.org/>`_ DataFrames can now be serialized and cached. Bionic will
  do this automatically when an entity function returns a value of the appropriate
  type, but it can also be explicitly controlled with the new :func:`@dask
  <bionic.protocol.dask>` protocol.

0.4.3 (Sep 13, 2019)
--------------------

Documentation Changes
.....................

- Square's `CLA
  <https://gist.github.com/square-cla/0dac5a22575ecf5e4f40825e7de51d5d>`_ was added to
  our `Contributing <contributing.html>`_ page.

0.4.2 (Sep 9, 2019)
-------------------

Improvements
............

- Bionic now uses ``IncompatibleEntityError`` to report problems where the
  user has defined multiple entities in an incompatible way. This is a subclass
  of ``ValueError``, which is what we used before.

Documentation Changes
.....................

- The `Flow Merging <concepts.html#combining-flows>`_ API, released in 0.4.0, is now
  correctly documented.

0.4.1 (Aug 29, 2019)
--------------------

This was our first public release as an open source project. There were no
code changes from the previous release.

Earlier Releases
................

Earlier releases of Bionic were internal to Square and never released on PyPI.
We might never get around to documenting them here.
