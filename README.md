# Bionic

Bionic is a framework for analyzing and modeling data in Python.  It's designed
to help you **iterate faster on your research**, and help your colleagues
**reuse your code more easily**.

Bionic is in alpha and evolving rapidly.  We recommend it for research projects
where the dataset fits in memory.  We do not recommend it for pipelines running
in production.

Check out the [full documentation](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
or go straight to [Get
Started](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/get-started.html).

## Installation

Bionic can be installed from PyPI:

    pip install bionic[standard]

You'll probably want to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) as well.
See the [Installation
docs](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/get-started.html#installation)
for more details on installing and configuring Bionic's dependencies.
